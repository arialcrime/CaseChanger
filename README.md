# Case Changer
This thingy adds 2 buttons to your Space Center window which allow you to change the text in there from lowercase to uppercase and vice versa.

This has not been tested extensively.

Thanks to [Thom Janssen](https://github.com/thomgb) for doing the ground work with his [PDFButtonSpace](https://github.com/thomgb/PDFButtonSpace) extension and [Tal Leming](https://github.com/typesupply) for [Vanilla](https://github.com/typesupply/vanilla), and [Frederik Berlaen](https://github.com/typemytype) for the comprehensive resources and helpful examples.
